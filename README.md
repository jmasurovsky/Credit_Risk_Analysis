# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to predict high or low credit risk using supervised machine learning algorithms. The idea is to compare algorithms that oversample the data, undersample, and a combination of both in order to reduce bias  LendingClub, a lending services company, has provided the credit card dataset in ordefr to perform the analysis.

## Results

- Oversampling the dataset, using the naive bayes algorithm, had a balance accuracy score of 64%, a precision score of 99%, and a recall score of 65%.

- Oversampling the dataset, using the SMOTE algorithm, had a balance accuracy score of 63%, a precision score of 99%, and a recall score of 65%.

- Undersampling the dataset, using the cluster centroids algorithm, had a balance accuracy score of 51%, a precision score of 99%, and a recall score of 41%.

- A combination of over and undersampling the dataset, using the SMOTEEN algorithm, had a balance accuracy score of 63%, a precision score of 99%, and a recall score of 53%.
